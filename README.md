# IngressDataDumpExplorer
*Also available in [Spanish](translations/README_es.md)*

### About
IngressDataDumpExplorer is a set of tools that allows you to visually explore your Ingress gamedata exported by Niantic as part of their GDPR compliance.

### How to get the data
Simply write an E-Mail to `privacy@nianticlabs.com`:

> Dear Sir or Madam,  
> I'd like to request a dump of the raw data Niantic stores about my Ingress account @<account_name>, as regulated under GDPR.  
> Yours sincerely,  
> <your_name>

### How to use
You have to extract the password protected zip you got from Niantic into a new folder called `dump` inside this sourcetree. It must contain files like `game_log.tsv`.

You can either build the application with `go build app.go import.go set.go` or download a precompiled release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Maxr1998/IngressDataDumpExplorer/releases).

Then, simply run the app/app.exe in a Terminal/Cmd.


**Alternatively**, you can run the app in docker with the following commands:
```bash
docker build . -t dump-explorer              # Needed once
docker run -p 8080:8080 dump-explorer:latest # Launch
```

Afterwards, navigate to `localhost:8080` in your favorite web browser (I only tested with Google Chrome).

**Notice:** For now, you first need to execute the following command once, to fix the format errors in Niantic's dump. This will be integrated into the application in the future.

```bash
sed -i 's/None\tNone$/None/g' game_log.tsv
```
